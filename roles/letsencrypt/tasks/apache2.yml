      Could not access the challenge file for the hosts/domains: {{ item.failed_hosts | join(', ') }}.
      Let's Encrypt requires every domain/host be publicly accessible.
      Make sure that a valid DNS record exists for {{ item.failed_hosts | join(', ') }} and that they point to this server's IP.
      If you don't want these domains in your SSL certificate, then remove them from `site_hosts`.
      See https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssl for more details.
